In addition I recommend you buy atleast 2-3 of those, for the reason of up to 20% of those micro controllers are dead on arrival. So to avoid having a bad board and needing to wait 3 more weeks for you order, buy 2-3 of them at once. {.is-info}</p> <ul> <li>Global: https://aliexpress.us/item/2251832671740023.html</li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/Buy/#433-mhz-rf-antenna","title":"433 MHz RF Antenna","text":"<p>433 MHz is the frequency the shocker listens to.

Alternatively proxy your parcel over the Netherlands or Luxembourg. The reason for the Zoll denying import is, that the Shocker is made for dogs.
