# Shocklink - Share codes
!!! danger "Safety Warning"
    **Don't wear the shocker somewhere near your neck or your heart.**  
    Check out [Safety](../safety/safety-rules.md) for more information. 

!!! question "What is a Share code?"
    Share codes make it possible for someone with a Shocklink.net account to directly control your shocker with their account.  
!!! Info "Share codes can only be used once! " 
    You need to generate a new code every time you want to share the controls of your shocker with a new person.
    Shares are permanent until unshared/deleted by the owner of the shocker.  


## What you need
- [Shocklink.net account](https://shocklink.net/)
- A working shocker ([see the First time Setup guide](openshock-first-setup.md))
- A person you trust

## Create a share code
1. Go to [Shocklink.net](https://shocklink.net/) and login.
2. Switch to the ``Shockers`` section and open the context menu of the shocker you want to get a share code for.

!!! Tip
    You can also pause a specific share to temporarily stop the person from using this shocker.  
    Inside the share list, click the pause button in front of their account name, do the same again to un-pause it.  
!!! Info "Deleting Shares"
    In the same context menu where you can edit the share code limits you can also click ``unshare`` to delete the share code, this will unbind the shocker from the persons account and they can no longer control the shocker.
