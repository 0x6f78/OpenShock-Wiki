## Setup ESP  
1. To Setup your ESP (this is the communication device between the API and your shocker) you have to connect it to a power source, like a USB power adapter or your PC's USB Port (the ESP uses USB-C).
2. After you powered up your ESP grab your **phone** and search for a Wi-Fi network named similar to this: ``Openshock-24:DC:C3:9F:72:C8`` and connect to it.

4. Lookup your Wi-Fi Network in the web-interface, press the green button next to it and type in your Wi-Fi password then press submit.
5. Set the RF TX Pin, that is the number of the IO pin that the RF antenna data is connected to. (default 12, for pishock boards that is 15, if you don't know your pin, try asking for help on our [Discord](https://shocklink.net/discord)), type in your pin and press **Set** to change it.
6. **On your PC** open [Shocklink.net](https://shocklink.net/) and create an account, if you don't have one already, after that go to ``Devices`` and click the **green + icon** at the lower right corner to create a new device.
