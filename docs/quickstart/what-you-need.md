# What you need

If you've found yourself here, chances are you're either looking to get shocked, or shock a friend or partner! We've written this quickstart guide to help you get shocking as fast as possible.

## Requirements

To get started with OpenShocks, you need three things:

### 1. An OpenShock server

This can be either a public or private OpenShock server. We recommend the [ShockLink.net](https://shocklink.net) public OpenShock instance.

Interested in hosting your own? Check out [Selfhosting](../diy/selfhosting.md).

### 2. An OpenShock Controller

This is a fancy way of saying "a micro-controller and a 433MHz radio". It bridges the gap between shockers and the OpenShock server.

- For pre-builts, check out the [Hardware vendors](../vendors/hardware/index.md).
- For building your own, after reading the [Buying guide](../quickstart/buying-guide.md), head over to our do-it-yourself [Assembly guide](../diy/assembling.md).

### 3. Shockers

This is the easy part! Head to the [Buying Guide](../quickstart/buying-guide.md) for all the information you'll need.
