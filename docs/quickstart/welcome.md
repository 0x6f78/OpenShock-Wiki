# Welcome

If you've found yourself here, chances are you're either looking to get shocked, or shock a friend or partner! We've written this quickstart guide to help you get shocking as fast as possible.

## Quickstart

To get started with OpenShocks, you need three things:

1. A public or private OpenShock server;
    - We recommend the [ShockLink.net](https://shocklink.net) public OpenShock instance.
    - If you want to host it yourself, see [Selfhosting](/selfhosting).
2. A ShockLink Controller:
    - This is a small piece of hardware, usually connected by USB-C.
    - For buying, see [Hardware/Buy](/hardware/buy/).
    - For DIY, see [Hardware/DIY](/hardware/diy/).
3. One or more shock collars!
