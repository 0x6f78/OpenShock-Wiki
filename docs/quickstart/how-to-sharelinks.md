  6.  After adding your shocker to the link you should be able to see the shockers controlls, that's it. Everyone with the share link can now controll your shocker.


   # Customize your Share link
You can set limits to ``strenght`` ``duration`` or what kind of ``command`` someone can use for each share link.  
You can also ``Pause`` the link so nobody can send commands via this link.  


  

  ## Edit the limits
  1. Open your share link page again and select the share link you want to edit, there you open the ``share links context menu`` and choose ``Edit Mode``.

  4. To ``exit`` the ``Edit Mode`` open the ``share links context menu`` again and choose ``Edit Mode``, this will return the controlls to their normal color indicating that the ``Edit Mode`` is not active anymore.





## Pause your Share link

  2. This will turn the ``Pause Icon`` into a ``red Play Icon`` and ``blur`` the shocker controlls telling you it's paused, as long as the link is paused it will not accept any commands.
