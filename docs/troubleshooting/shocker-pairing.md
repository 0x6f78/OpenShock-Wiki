# Troubleshooting: Shocker Pairing

## Shocker Pairing Mode

Make sure you shocker is in Pairing Mode when trying to send a command. It can be any command, at any intensity, and any duration.
Recommended command is Vibrate at 2-5 seconds.


### Caixianlin Shocker
For the Caixianlin shockers that is done by holding the power button down for 2-3 seconds. It will beep and start to flash its led fast. While it is flashing fast send your command.


### Petrainer
Depending on what Petrainer model you have this might be a bit different.
For the 998DR you should just be able to press the power button once, that should put it into pairing mode by default.
